            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                The goal of the Computing Resources Unit is to provide the best possible customer service, application development, and technology infrastructure to support the business needs of the Dean’s Office and the College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences and its departments.
            </p>
            <p>
                We achieve this by working in collaboration with our customers, the campus technical community, and service providers as partners or leaders towards the common goal of user-friendly, reliable, secure, and efficient computing for the students, staff, and faculty of the University of California and its stakeholders.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Groups</h2>
            <h3>Help Desk/Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>The Help Desk and Infrastructure group provides computer support to the Dean’s Office, Centers and Institutes, numbering over 300 workstations, 150 laptops, and 100 mobile devices. In addition to client computer support, the group maintains the infrastructure for the various services offered: email/calendaring, printing, websites, business applications, databases, etc., as well as providing computer security consulting and remediation for the college under the Cyber-Safety Program.</p>
            <h3>Business Application Development</h3>
            <p>The Application Development group writes systems to automate critical business functions. The group retains close ties with application users, so many of the systems evolve continually to address new needs or to meet changes (such as updates in DaFIS accounting databases). The Application group authored and maintains business applications such as Faculty Recruitments, Pre-Purchasing, Student Information Management System, and internal time reporting systems, to name a few.</p>
