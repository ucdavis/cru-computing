Account information as well as line items require an extra level of awareness to edit. Changing of this information could potentially result in the order being rerouted and the current user losing access to the request.

To select an account or line item:

1. Scroll to the section above the "Line Items" section.

3. Click "OK" on the warning dialog (after reading).
4. Line items and account information should now be editable.
