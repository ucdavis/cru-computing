Using just the standard roles (Requester, Approver, Account Manager and Purchaser), no. A role was added called "Reviewer" that will allow that type of behavior.

Ex. If you would like all your requesters in a given workgroup to see each other's orders, place them in both the Requester and Reviewer role.
