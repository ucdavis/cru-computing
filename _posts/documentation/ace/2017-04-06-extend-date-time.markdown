1. An evaluation's closing date and time may be changed as long as it has not ~~already closed~~ been released.
2. An evaluation's opening date and time may be changed as long as it is pending and will not open withing one hour.
3. Be careful not to change the dates such that it will automatically be opened or closed unless that is what you intend because you will not be able to change it back.
4. To re-open an evaluation that has closed but not yet released, go to the closed section and select the class details for the course you want to re-open:

5. Then select the details as you would from the pending list
