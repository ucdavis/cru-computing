If your subject code is in the wrong department in Banner, or for some reason you really need to separate out that subject code into its own department we now have a way to override which subject codes belong to a department.

If the subject code exists in a Scheduling Department currently setup on Ace, we will contact all those admins and inform them it will be moved in 1 week unless someone objects.

**Some consequences:**
- If evaluations have been created for that subject code for the current term, even if we move that subject code into its own department the courses will be "claimed" for the current term by the current department.
- Templates are for that subject code only.
- Reporting is for that subject code only.
- When we implement Summary Reports (that average evaluations), only evaluations for that subject will be able to be used.
