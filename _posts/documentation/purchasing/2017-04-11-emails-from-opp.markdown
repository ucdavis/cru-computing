As a user of the PrePurchasing system you are automatically enrolled into our mailing lists. **You cannot opt-out of these mailing lists.**  We will use these mailing lists from time to time to notify you of major updates or emergency system outages.

Our IT team cannot remove you from the mailing lists.  The only way to stop receiving email messages from either of our mailing lists is to have your permissions removed from PrePurchasing.  If you would like to proceed with removing your permissions please consult one of the contacts on the following page: [https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/user/contact](https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/user/contact). The departmental contacts on the page are the only ones who are able to remove your permissions.
