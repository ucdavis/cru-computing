An evaluation's response is final once submitted and may not be altered in any fashion due to two important reasons:

1) The responses are completely anonymous, therefore there is no way to link any response to an individual student (thus not even the students themselves can change their responses once finalized).

2) Ace is the campus system of record for these evaluation results, specifically designed to save all the students responses unadulterated.
