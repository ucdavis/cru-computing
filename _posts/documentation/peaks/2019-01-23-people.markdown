# People:

## Adding people:
* If you just have a couple people you want to add, go to the People asset and click "+ Add Person"
* Enter the person's email or kerberous id and click search.
* If the person is found you can now customize the person. The person's details can be different for different teams.
* If you have many people to add for a department, the easiest way is to do a bulk load
  * To do a bulk load, you will need to know the PPS department code
  * Click the Admin link
  * Click Add PPS Department on the right
  * Add the PPS Department code and Click add to team
  * Click Bulk Load People on the right and continue


## People details:
* From the details of a person you can see everything that is assigned to them in the team.
* You can add new assets directly to the person from here
* You can edit or delete people from this page as well.
* If you need to find what other teams a person might belong to (maybe they are being dismissed), you can use the Look Teams. This will bring you to a new page listing the teams the person belongs to and the Admin(s) for those teams.
* The history at the bottom shows recent actions, but not all of them.
