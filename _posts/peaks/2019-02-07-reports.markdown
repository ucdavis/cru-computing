# Reports:
There are currenly three main reports
* Expiring Items
* Supervisor's Direct Reports
* Items Pending Acceptance

## Expiring Items
The expiring items report is a useful place to go to see a summary of the items that are expiring before a particular date. It defaults to 2 days from now and all items you have access to.
Depanding on your access, you can filter this to just show Access, Key, Equipment, or workstations.
Once you change any of the filters, click refresh report.
The information can be sorted by clicking on the column headings (shift click allows sorting on multiple columns).
You may search for any information in the displayed table.
The Details link for a row will bring you to that items page where you can further act on it. FOr example, extend the expiration date or revoke access.
