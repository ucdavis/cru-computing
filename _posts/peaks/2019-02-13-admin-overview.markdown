# New team setup steps

## Configuration
First, you want to click on Admin or Administer Team:


![Admin Links](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-start.png "Admin Links")

## Step 1
Add FIS Orgs. This adds spaces to your team. Click Add new org code:


![FIS Org](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-orgs-link.png "Fis Org")


From here specify the Chart (Almost always 3) and the org code. Then click Add org to team:


![FIS Org](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-orgs-add.png "Fis Org")

This will populate the spaces tab of your team assets. You may specify multiple orgs.

## Step 2
Next, we would recommend bulk loading people in your department. This can be done later if you wish, or people may be added individually.

To bulk load people, you need to first add one or more PPS Departments:

![PPS Dept](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-add-pps-dept.png "PPS Dept")

Then open the Bulk load people form:

More information on the people asset can be found here :
