# New team setup steps

## Configuration
First, you want to click on Admin or Administer Team:


![Admin Links](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-start.png "Admin Links")

## Step 1
Add FIS Orgs. This adds spaces to your team. Click Add new org code:


![FIS Org](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-orgs-link.png "Fis Org")


From here specify the Chart (Almost always 3) and the org code. Then click Add org to team:


![FIS Org](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-orgs-add.png "Fis Org")

This will populate the spaces tab of your team assets. You may specify multiple orgs.

## Step 2
Next, we would recommend bulk loading people in your department. This can be done later if you wish, or people may be added individually.

To bulk load people, you need to first add one or more PPS Departments:

![PPS Dept](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-add-pps-dept.png "PPS Dept")

Then open the Bulk load people form:

![Bulk Load People](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-bulk-load.png "Bulk Load People")


More information on the people asset can be found here :
[Peaks People](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/faq/peaks/people)

## Step 3
Adding Tags. This can be done later, but for tags to be available for other non departmantal admins (Key Master for example) they will have to be added first.
Tags are useful for filtering items on the individual asset pages. For example, you could create a "Student" tag and add that to all the person assets that are students.

To get to the form to manage your team's tags, you must click menu and then team tags:

![Team Tags Link](https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/media/peaks/admin-tags-link.png "Team Tags Link")

From here you can Create, Edit, and Delete tags for your teams.
