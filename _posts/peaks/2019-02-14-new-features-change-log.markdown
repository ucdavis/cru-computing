# New Features and Changes

## March 1, 2019
* Added a notes field to all asset types.
* For equipment, added a dropdown "type" field. If Card is selected, Make and Model will be hidden. The following choices:
  * Default
  * Computer
  * Device
  * Card
  * Industrial
  * Other
* If other choices are needed and useful, we are open to adding them to the list, but we don't want it to get too long.

## Feb 26, 2019
* Minor changes to the confirm asset assignment page (For the end user, not admins.)
* Changed around the Admin menu a little for Importing CSV files as we added the ability to import equipment.
* Added Ability to import equipment via a CSV file. It works in a similar way to importing keys.

## Feb 21, 2019
* Added a import results table that can be downloaded
