# New Features and Changes

## March 5, 2019
* Trouble finding the org that is related to you space? No problem, we've added a building search to the page where you add orgs to your team. Just enter the building name, or part of the name and search. This will list all the building and departments in them with the org code that Facilities uses for that space. For here you can just click Add to add that org to your team.
* It is possible the org code that Facilities has for the space is no longer valid in KFS. Previously we would not have allowed this to be added as it is no longer valid, but now we check to see what is in the spaces as well and will allow an invalid org to be added. 
## March 1, 2019
* Added a notes field to all asset types.
* For equipment, added a dropdown "type" field. If Card is selected, Make and Model will be hidden. The following choices:
  * Default
  * Computer
  * Device
  * Card
  * Industrial
  * Other
* If other choices are needed and useful, we are open to adding them to the list, but we don't want it to get too long.

## Feb 26, 2019
* Minor changes to the confirm asset assignment page (For the end user, not admins.)
* Changed around the Admin menu a little for Importing CSV files as we added the ability to import equipment.
* Added Ability to import equipment via a CSV file. It works in a similar way to importing keys.

## Feb 21, 2019
* Added a import results table that can be downloaded

## Feb 14, 2019
* Added ability for Departmental Admin to import keys and potentially assign them by importing a csv file.
* A new choice is available from the Admin menu "CSV Import Keys"
