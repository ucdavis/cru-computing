1. An evaluation's closing date and time may be changed as long as it has not already closed.
2. An evaluation's opening date and time may be changed as long as it is pending and will not open withing one hour.
3. Be careful not to change the dates such that it will automatically be opened or closed unless that is what you intend because you will not be able to change it back.
