<p>UC Davis is enforcing a new security measure to protect campus computing accounts, known as Duo MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).  Essentially, when your campus computing account is protected with Duo, it means that in addition to your UC Davis username and password, youâ€™ll need a third thing which only you can access, when you authenticate using your campus computing account.  We recommend using a smartphone as that third thing as almost all iPhone/Android/Windows Mobile phones will work.</p>
<br />
<p>If you are unable to use a landline for any reason, please consider one of the other methods below or <a class="external-link" href="https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/documentation/help-desk-ticket" target="_parent">create a Helpdesk ticket</a> for further assistance.</p>
