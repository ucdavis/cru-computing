<p>UC Davis is enforcing a new security measure to protect campus computing accounts, known as Duo MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).  Essentially, when your campus computing account is protected with Duo, it means that in addition to your UC Davis username and password, youâ€™ll need a third thing which only you can access, when you authenticate using your campus computing account.</p>
<br />
<p>While we do recommend using a smartphone as that third thing as almost all iPhone/Android/Windows Mobile phones will work, If you are unable to use a smartphone for any reason, please consider one of the other methods below or <a class="external-link" href="https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/documentation/help-desk-ticket" target="_parent">create a Helpdesk ticket</a> for further assistance.</p>
<br />

<p>If you currently access your Office 365 mailbox using the built-in Mail app on an iPhone or iPad, you must <a class="external-link" href="https://computing.caes.ucdavis.edu/documentation/readd-mailbox-to-ios-after-duo" target="_blank">remove and readd your email account</a> after Duo is enabled on the mailbox, which generally takes about 15-60 minutes to process.
