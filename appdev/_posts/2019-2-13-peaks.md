description: "The goal of PEAKS is to provide a centralized system where teams can plan and track their most critical resources, enabling them to answer difficult questions like exactly which keys and computers are assigned to a specific person, when they acknowledged receipt of those items, what rooms they can access with those keys, and much, much more."
