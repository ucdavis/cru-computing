# Tips and Tricks
- If you edit a Chartstring you don't have access to edit, you can duplicate it to a team and folder you do have access to. You will always have access to your Personal team and Default folder.
- You can create a partial Chartstring with values that you commonly use and use that to create new Chartstrings by using the duplicate button. Just open the partial one, make your changes, give it a new name and/or folder location and click dupllicate.
- You can try converting a KFS account. Just manually enter the KFS account in the format chart-account-subaccount in the deatils URL like [https://finjector.ucdavis.edu/details/3-CRU9033](https://finjector.ucdavis.edu/details/3-CRU9033)
- You can create a new Chartstring from the main page, but if you want to edit it you must first go through the details page.
