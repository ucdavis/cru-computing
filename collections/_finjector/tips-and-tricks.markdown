# Tips and Tricks
- If you edit a Chart String you don't have access to edit, you can duplicate it to a team and folder you do have access to. You will always have access to your Personal team and Default folder.
- You can create a partial Chart String with values that you commonly use and use that to create new Chart Strings by using the duplicate button. Just open the partial one, make your changes, give it a new name and/or folder location and click duplicate.
- You can create a new Chart String from the main page, but if you want to edit it you must first go through the details page.
- A Natural Account/Expenditure Type is required for a valid ChartString. You may leave it as zeros as some applications will set this to a specific value. You may also want to enter a value such as General Office Supplies.
- The details page will show a complete list of errors and/or warnings if applicable.
- From the details page, and many other places, if you hover over a value you may copy that to the clipboard. A copy icon and help ballon will appear if you can.
