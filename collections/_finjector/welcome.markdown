# Welcome to Finjector

  - Finjector, short for Financial Chartstring Injector, is a helper application that allows you to build and save Aggie Enterprise Chart Strings for use in other applications.
  - If Finjector is integrated with the calling application, there should be a button next to where you would enter a Chart String that will open a popup window. This window will let you use existing Chart Strings, and using them will paste them into the calling application's entry field.
  - You may also use Finjector as a standalone application to create teams, folders, and Chart Strings for later use, or to manually copy into other applications.
