# Teams

  - Everyone who uses finjector has a personal team with a default folder. This would only be visible in the list of Chartstrings if you have added Chartstrings to that folder.
  - The main purpose of creating a team is to be able to create lists of Chartstrings for other users. Ideally, your accounting people will have done this for you. You may also want to do this to organize your own Chartstrings into different folders.
  - Teams have permissions that override any permissions that a child folder may have.
  - Teams may be accessed by the menu in the upper right.
  - The personal team and the default folder in it are specail and may not be shared, deleted, or renamed. Chartstrings may be created in there, or duplicated into it.

## Permissions
- If you have a higher level of permission in a team, that will take precedence over any lower level of permission in a folder.

### Admin
- Admins can do anything with the team and any of the team's folders.
- The main purpose of this role is to be able to add and remove users from the team or folders.

### Edit
- Editors can add, remove, and change folders and the Chartstrings within them.
- If the user only has editor permission in a folder, they will only be able to add, remove, and change Chartstrings in that folder.

### View 
- Viewers can only view the Chartstrings in the team's folders. If they have view access in the team, they will be able to see all the team's folder's Chartstrings.
