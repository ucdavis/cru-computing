# Test

- You don't need to add a map to your event.
- You can navigate to the map section from the item list, or if you are in item Edit or Details, from the Item Actions button.
- If you have a map, the first map pin you add will be the primary pin. This would probably be the location of your event.
- You can't remove your primary pin unless you remove any other pins first.
- You can edit any of the pin information except if it is the primary pin.
- End users can see a map with directions if you have multiple pins.
- Not shown in the video, the map location for the end user is in a differ position for mobile devices.
