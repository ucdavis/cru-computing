# Coupons

* There is currently no way to edit coupons, or delete ones that you have created. Please keep that in mind when creating coupons.
* Payers can remove and add coupons. Please keep this in mind when creating coupons that don't expire.
* Coupons are not linked to specific payers, but they are "Team" specific.


## Non Expiring Coupons
* You can't edit a non expiring coupon to disable it, but if there is an issue with this, please contact us with a help ticket. (From support in the Payments app.)
* They can be reused by anyone who knows the code or can guess the code.


## Expiring Coupons
* The expiration date will now be shown on the invoice and emails.
* If a payer pays their invoice after it has expired that will show on the pay page. On this page they also have the ability to add and remove the coupon.
