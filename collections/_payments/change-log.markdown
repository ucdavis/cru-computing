# New Features and Changes

## Sept 17, 2019
* Fixed display of dates. Previously, dates were displayed in UTC. Now dates are displayed in Pacific Time.
* Updated when the expiration date for a coupon cuts off. The coupon will remain active until the end of the date that was entered.
* When viewing a sent invoice
  * The Invoice and Receipt icons on the buttons have changed to a download.
  * Clicking on this will download instead of trying to show the PDF in a browser window. (A small scrolling window in the browser was displayed).
* The list of invoices on the dashboard will display up to 1000 invoices. If you encounter performance problems with this page:
    1) Let us know with a help ticket.
    2) Try adjusting the filter in the mean time to show less records

## Prior to Sept 17, 2019
* Fixed the issue where sending invoices to multiple customers failed and they had to be individually sent.
* Other enhancements
