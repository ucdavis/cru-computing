# Trouble adding key to person:

## Issue
I can't add a key to a person from the details of the person

## Solution
* If you can't see keys at all, you may not have the correct permissions.
* When adding key serials (the physical key) to a person directly, you can only search for existing unassigned key serials. You can't add them here. If you need to add the key serial, go to the keys tab, find the key, click details and add the key serial from there. At this time you may also assign it to a person.
