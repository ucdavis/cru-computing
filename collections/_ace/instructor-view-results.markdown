If they go here: [https://eval.ucdavis.edu/Instructor](https://eval.ucdavis.edu/Instructor)

This will list all their released results.

From here, they can click on the "Instructor" menu to view their current evaluations (Pending, Open, Closed (Unreleased)) This list will allow them to preview the evaluation to see what students would see.
Also from here they may download a PowerPoint slide that they can modify to present to students as a reminder where to go to fill out their evaluations.
