## Summarize Summarize Summarize

Improvements to the summarize feature was the most requested change to Ace, and we finally had the time to implement it. :)
Behind the scenes we also made some speed improvements for generating these reports.

## Instructor Summarize

Instructors can summarize their own evaluations. This will only show the information relevant to that instructor and the summarize can generate the scores or the summary report (scores + comments).

- Select one or more evaluations with the checkbox on the right side of the list.
- The checkbox in the header can be used to select/deselect visible evaluations.
- The search can be uses to limit the evaluations you want to summarize for quicker selection
- A new last page has been added to the report that shows information about the evaluations selected.

## Staff Summarize
The staff summarize is similar to the instructor summarize except they can do a comparison summarize which is basically what the previous summarize did.

- When summarizing, you may not summarize for a specific instructor. All instructors listed in the evaluations will be written to the report
