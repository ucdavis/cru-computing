There are two ways this can happen:

1. A staff member manually releases they results of the evaluation.

2. Automatically by a nightly process that checks banner to see if all the registered students have been graded. Note, there can be a delay between when the grades are submitted and when banner gets updated. And if this happens after our nightly process, it will not be updated in Ace until the next night.

**Note: The typical delay between when your grades are submitted and when the evaluation is released is about 4 or 5 days.**
