<p><span class="discreet">The College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences Dean's Office provides access to a Remote Desktop connection for all units, centers, and departments supported by the Computing Resources Unit.  The Remote Desktop service can be accessed from any internet connected computer, including computers at home.</span></p>
