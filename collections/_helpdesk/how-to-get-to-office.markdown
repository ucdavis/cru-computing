<ol>
<li>Entering Mrak Hall from the North side, walk through both sets of glass doors.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/1.jpg">

<li>In the lobby of Mrak Hall, proceed to the right.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/2.jpg">

<li>When you turn right inside the lobby you will be facing the The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Dean's Office (150 Mrak Hall).</li>

<img src="/media/steps/3.jpg">

<li>While we are part of the CA&ES Dean's Office we are not in the main office, we're located downstairs. On your right is a pair of elevators.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/4.jpg">

<li>Press the bottom button to go down. Once an elevator arrives and you're safely inside press "B" for Basement.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/5.jpg">

<li>When you exit the elevator, head to the left.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/6.jpg">

<li>We are in a short hallway between the men's and women's restrooms on your right side. After you pass the men's restroom turn right.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/7.jpg">

<li>Our hallway has an S curve just like the Bay Bridge, so stay to the right, go no faster than 35mph and follow the flow of the road.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/8.jpg">

<li>After the left turn in the short hallway the room will open up and now you are officially inside our unit office! The conference table is located on the right after you walk past the cubicle wall.</li>

<img src="/media/steps/9.jpg">

<li>And you have arrived!</li>

We also have created an overlay of the steps on top of the buildings floor plan.
