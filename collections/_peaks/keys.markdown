# Keys:
Keys consit of two parts. The Key and the Key Serial. The Key can be considered the pattern for the key. It opens specific doors/spaces. The Key Serial is the physical key with a unique serial number that has the same "pattern" as the key.

## Searching
* Searching is additive (and logic).
* You can search keys for tags. Only tags in the team can be searched.
* To clear a search item either backspace over it or click on the small “x” next to the search term.
* Any column with an input field over it can be search for what is in that column.
* Videos showing searching can also be found [HERE](/documentation/peaks/searching)

## Columns
* The Serials column shows how many of those are assigned to someone (in Use) and the total number of serials.
* Spaces indicates the number of doors/spaces the key and the associated key serials will open.
* Actions
  * The actions column can only delete a key. If there are any Key serials or spaces associated, those will be removed as well.
* Details
  * The details link brings you to the page where you can:
    * Edit the key
    * Act on Key Serials
    * Act on spaces for that key
    * View the last few actions in the history
