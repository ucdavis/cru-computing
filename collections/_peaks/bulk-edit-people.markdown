# Bulk Edit People
The bulk edit can be access from the admin menu:

</a>

## Selecting people to edit
* If you scroll down, you can see a list of all active people in your team.
* This list can be sorted and filtered
* Click on the headings to sort. Type in the Search box to filter rows.
* To select/unselect people to edit, click on the rows, ctrl+click or shift+click to select/unselect multiple rows.

</a>

## Deleting selected people
* If you choose to delete people from your team, that is the only option you can choose.
* Deleted people can be re-added (reactivated). But not from here. They would have to be added from the asset people page or the Bulk Load.
* Deleted people can be viewed with the "Actions Against the People" report

* If the Update checkbox is selected, but nothing is specified for the field, it will be clear out.
* Date fields can be cleared out with the "x" depending on the browser used.
* After the selected people have been updated, you will return to this page with your options still selected.
