* Searching tags uses "and" logic
* Click the x to remove search values
* Only tags listed for the team may be searched, but it is possible for the asset to have a tag that isn't listed

* Searching is additive (and logic).
* You can search equipment for tags. Only tags in the team can be searched.
* You can search Attributes.
  * Attributes are key - value pairs that may be added to each equipment item
  * Attributes are free form text, after you type something, click on the "Search for: ..." below the field to add it as a search item.
  * When searching you can search for both the key and/or value
  * For example, you could have multiple Keys of "PrePurchasing" and Values of the link in PrePurchasing. You could search for either. Or a Key of Serial Number and the value of the serial number.
  * If you are searching for both the key and attribute, make sure you click the "search for:..." for each of these values otherwise it will only match the phrase instead of each word.
* To clear a search item either backspace over it or click on the small "x" next to the search term
* Any column with an input field over it can be search for what is in that column.
