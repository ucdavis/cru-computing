* Questions are grouped into Question Sets.
* Questions should not be added or removed once people have started registering for your event. This can cause issues with reporting.
* Contact Information question set is a reserved name and cannot be reused. The Contact Information question set cannot be removed or edited.
* Question Sets can be added directly to your event as well as added as a user-reusable question set when not created from within the event. Note, this does not effect copying your event.
* Question Sets can be added to your event in two places.
* The Transaction Question Sets are asked once per registration and appear near the bottom of the registration form.
* Quantity Question Sets are asked once for each quantity the end users specifies. They are asked near the top of the form and are grouped together.
* A good use of the quantity question sets would be too ask attendee information.
* You don't need to create any question sets or create multiple ones, it just depends on what information you want to gather. We recommend creating a test event on the *test* site to see what things will look like and avooid cluttering up the production site.
* As long as no one has registered for your event, you can remove and edit your question sets.
