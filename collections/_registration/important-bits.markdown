## Technical

* Do not paste text directly into the format-able text boxes. Instead use the insert as plain text widget on the text box.
* Make sure you pick the correct account or the money collected will go to the wrong account.
* You can now filter the account list to make it easier to find the one you want.
* For your questionsets, don't change them after people have registered. You may not be able to change them and it will probably create issues when you make and run reports.
* We currently don't allow the questions to be reordered, so make sure you know how you want it to look before you begin.
* You may want to create an event on the test system first to see how everything will look.
