Notifications are generated when a registration is "paid".
* This can happen in several ways.
* The customer selected a credit card payment and successfully processed their credit card.
* The customer selected check and you entered check information totaling the amount for the event.
* The customer had a free event and successfully registered. (An event of $0 or a coupon discount that reduced the total to $0.)


## Resend a notification

* Select the Notifications tab.
* Find the registration by transaction number.
* Click Send.
* A message will be displaying showing the email the notification was sent to.

## Find the email for a transaction number

* The email isn't shown on this list.
* Open the reports tab.
* Select the Transaction report or a custom report you have created that has the information you want.
* Quickly find the related information by entering information in the search field at the top right of the table.
