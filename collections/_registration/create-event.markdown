## Item Type:
* Determines what extended properties are available.
* Contact Information in the extended properties has been added to all of the existing item types.
* If you need a new specific item type for your events, you can submit a help ticket and we will evaluate it to determine if it should be added.
* Some Item Types (College Celebration) my have defaulted question sets.
* Cannot be edited after the event is saved.

## Name
* Your event needs a name. This is displayed in several places and can be edited later.

## Unit
* You will probably only have 1 unit to choose from. If you have access to more, please pick the appropriate one.

## Account Number
* The account number is now always required, even if Credit Cards are not used or if it is free.
* You can now filter the list of accounts by typing part of it.
* Note, it isn't a wild card search, you need to type the beginning of the account and/or chart.

## Summary
* Limited to 750 characters
* Displayed on your event "tile" on the home page.
* Also displayed at the top of the page where the user enters their information.
* Just plain text.

## Description
* Only paste plain text. The is a button that allows you to paste plain text if you have copied it from a rich source. We recommend that you use this button to paste text at all times as it may not be obvious that the text you have coped was from a rich source.
* You can use the built in formatting tools to format the text.
* You can put in non-clickable links. Please use the Insert Plain Text button to paste in any URL links.
* This is a fairly large field and can contain a lot of text.
* We recommend that you include any refund police in this area.

## Check Payment Instructions
* Defaults to the information you see.
* Can be changed.
* This information is displayed after a user registers for your event if they have selected (and are allowed) to pay be check.
* This is a rich editor the same as the description field, please use the same techniques if you need to edit it.

## Allow Credit Payment
* Select this if you are going to accept payment by credit card.

## Allow Check Payment
* Select this is you are going to accept payment by check.
* If your event is free, only select this choice

## Name of Item
* This defaults to Ticket
* Just a general note. You are not allowed to sell physical things on this site. If you do have a need to sell things, we have another invoicing application that could be useful.
* This is displayed in several places for the end user. Typically "Price per Ticket" if you keep the default value.

## Cost Per Ticket
* The maximum amount you will charge per ticket for your event.
* Should only contain numbers and a decimal point if needed. Do not put in $ or commas.
* You can't have multiple prices, but you can have coupons that can reduce this amount (such as early bird specials).
* Must be a positive amount or zero.

## Number of Ticket(s) Available
* The number of tickets that can be purchased before your event is sold out.
* This value can be edited later if you need to adjust the amount.
* When this get below 10 available, the owner of the event should get an email notification.
* A registration that isn't paid yet still uses these up unless the registration is deactivated (I'll get to that in another video/FAQ).
