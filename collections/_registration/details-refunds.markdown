* Refunds for credit card transactions can only be done for the credit card within a few months of the transaction. If it is outside of the allowed date range, the accounting people will let you know and follow up with you.
* You need the refunder role and need to be an editor for the event to do refunds. Most everyone should have the refunder role. You can submit a help ticket to inquire further if needed.
* Refunds for checks must be done by your department. No refund notification will be generated.
* Refunds for credit cards will generate an email notification to our accounting department, who will process the refund within 7-10 days. Once the refund has been processed, our accounting department will notify you that it has been done. If you don't hear back within 10 days, please submit a help ticket.


## Requesting a refund

* From the Refunds tab, find the transaction you wish to refund. Click "Refund".
* Enter a refund amount. Generally, this should be the full amount. 
* Enter a reason for the refund.
* If you experience any errors, please submit a help ticket and we can investigate for you.

## Cancel a refund

* If you need to cancel the refund, click undo. Note, if the refund has already been processed canceling the refund will not work, but our accounting department can follow up with you.
* Undo does not have a "Confirmation" page. Please be careful that you click on the correct transaction.
* A success message will be displayed at the top of the page.
