# Delete Event

It isn't possible to delete events after they are created. We suggest that you edit it to:
* Change the Name of the event so you know it isn't a real one.
* Make it so it isn't available to the public.
* Add a pass phrase just in case

Eventually, we plan on adding a "Hide Item" flag so it doesn't show up on the list by default, but until we implement that change, please use the methods above.
