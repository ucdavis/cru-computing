* The link to the Admin Home page can be found at the bottom of the page.
* The Items button is a link you all the events you have access to. From here you can create new events, edit them, and access the information for your events.
* Question Sets lets you create reusable question sets for your events. (You will most likely be limited to creating ones for just yourself.)
* Administrative Screens are for Overall Admins only. You will probably not have access to these.
* What's New is a change log located in this FAQ: [Change Log](/documentation/registration/registration-change-log)
* Admin Help Ticket: This is for admins only. It is not for the general public. You need CAS authentication to submit help ticket. As an admin of events, you are expected to be the primary contact for questions from those registering for events.
* The More Actions allows a basic lookup for orders placed in your events, it isn't particularly useful. You may also submit help tickets from here and log out of CAS.
