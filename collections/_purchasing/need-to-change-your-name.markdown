Name Changed?
Need to enter the *witness* protection program?
----------

Please first try updating from the campus systems by using this link (Profile in PrePurchasing menu):
[PrePurchasing User Profile](https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/User/Profile)

Click the button. If it doesn't update correctly, follow the instructions below.


We can change it for you, it is a manual process, so just submit a help ticket from within Prepurchasing with your new or correct name and we will update it for you.

You can also create a help ticket from here:
[PrePurchasing Help Ticket](https://caeshelp.ucdavis.edu/?appname=OPP)
