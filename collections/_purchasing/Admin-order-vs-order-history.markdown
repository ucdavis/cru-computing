So what orders do I see in the Admin Order History Page, and how does this compare to the Order History Page?

## Admin Order History:

- Orders that are at your level where you have access to them because of your role in an Administrative - non full featured workgroup. This includes orders which have been assigned to someone else, even if their away status is not set.
- Orders that you have access to because of a Reviewer role in an administrative workgroup.
- Max 1000 orders will be displayed.

## Order History:
- Orders that you have acted on.
- Orders that you have created.
- Orders that are at your level that you have access to because of your role in the related workgroup, or your role in an Admin - Full Featured workgroup. This does not include orders that are directly assigned to someone else unless their away status is set.
- Orders that you have Reviewer access to through the related workgroup, or an Admin - Full Featured workgroup.
- Max 1000 orders will be displayed.
