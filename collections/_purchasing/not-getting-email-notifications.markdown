The first thing to check is your junk mail or spam folder. If your notifications are being caught there, you will need to add opp-noreply@ucdavis.edu to the Safe Senders.

The other thing you can check is you email preferences.

Check to see if notifications for particular events are turned off.

Check to see your correct email is being used. This can be found under your profile in the upper right.

Check to see if the notification type is set to daily or weekly.

if you are using many email filters to automatically sort your email, do a complete search of all your mail folders for opp emails. You may have created a filter that incorrect sorted prepurchasing emails to another folder.
