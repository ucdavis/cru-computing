If you would like to proceed with removing your permissions please consult one of the contacts on the following page: [https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/user/contact](https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/user/contact). The departmental contacts on the page are the only ones who are able to remove your permissions.
