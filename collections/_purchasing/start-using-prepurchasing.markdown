If your department is not using PrePurchasing, but you would like too, then someone will need to become a Departmental Administrator.

To get Departmental Administrator Access you will need to request access on this page:

[https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/DepartmentalAdminRequest/Create](https://prepurchasing.ucdavis.edu/DepartmentalAdminRequest/Create)

On this page there is also a link to register for our required class, held about once a month.

Once you have taken the class, we will send you an email for the next steps, which are basically creating a workgroup and related orders on our test system.

If your department already has a Departmental Administrator, you will need to contact them and they can grant you access.
